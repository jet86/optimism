## 1. Compiling, running, and deploying.

For example, to compile, test, and then deploy the contract on OMGX Rinkeby:

First create `.env` file similar to `.env.example`, replace the private key with your private key. 

Then execute the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn compile:omgx
$ yarn test:integration:omgx
```
